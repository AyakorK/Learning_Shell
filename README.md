# Learning_Shell

My first mission into OpenSourcePolitics was to create a script to learn shell that will add a confirmation when we are removing a folder that contains a 
.important file

# How to use it 
- Install it 
- Use the command ./main.sh {folder_name}
- If you want to make a confirmation your folder MUST contain a file named .important don't forget it otherwise it will erase it without any confirmation
- Use it and be safe with your using
